# OverVibez backend (Supabase)

Project: `overvibez-prod` (ref `ectwnzhuebgnvejdpgdk`, eu-west-2)
URL: https://ectwnzhuebgnvejdpgdk.supabase.co (publishable key is embedded in `index.html`; it is safe to ship — RLS enforces access)

Apply migrations in order: `001_core_schema.sql`, `002_storage_realtime.sql`, `003_post_id_and_creator_defaults.sql`.
(On `overvibez-prod` 001+003 were applied as one migration, `core_schema`, then `storage_realtime`.)

## Security model
- Clients can only write low-risk columns directly (column-level grants). Wallet, earnings, `age_verified`, post counters,
  subscriptions, unlocks, raffle entries, transactions and payouts are written only by SECURITY DEFINER functions.
- Money moves only through `purchase_post`, `subscribe_to_creator`, `tip_creator`, `buy_raffle_entries`, `request_payout`
  (85/15 split in `_settle`). All require `age_verified`.
- Paid media lives in the private `paid-media` bucket; storage RLS defers to `can_view_post()`.

## Not built yet (needed before launch)
- Something must set `profiles.age_verified` (ID-verification webhook using the service role). Until then nobody can buy or publish.
- Wallet top-ups (Stripe webhook that credits `wallet_cents` and logs a `wallet_topup` transaction) and bank payouts (Stripe Connect).
- Raffle creation + provably-fair draw (service-role edge function). No raffles are seeded.
- Live streaming, comments UI, notifications, moderation tooling, Terms/Privacy pages.
- Auth: decide whether email confirmation stays on (the app handles both).
